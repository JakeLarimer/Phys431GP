CATALOG OF PARAMETERS FOR MILKY WAY GLOBULAR CLUSTERS - https://physics.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat (100+ GC objects in Milky Way)
The Connection between Globular Cluster Systems and the Host Galaxies - https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005481 (Short paper, outlines correlations between GCs and host galaxies, has data)
