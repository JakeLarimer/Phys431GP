The ACS Virgo and Fornax Cluster Surveys - https://www.acsvcs.org/ (I think this has a lot of data on galaxies and GCs within them so could be rly good)
CATALOG OF PARAMETERS FOR MILKY WAY GLOBULAR CLUSTERS - https://physics.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat (100+ GC objects in Milky Way)
The Connection between Globular Cluster Systems and the Host Galaxies - https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005481 (Short paper, outlines correlations between GCs and host galaxies, has data)
Comparing Globular Cluster System Properties with Host Galaxy Environment - https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ace340 (good paper, probably helpful)
GCSCAT - Globular Cluster Systems of Galaxies Catalog - https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/w3browse/all/gcscat.html (Paper and measurements of 400+ galaxies and corresponding GC systems)
